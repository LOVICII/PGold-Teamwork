The project is really nice, but there are some key points that I'd like to mention.
1. The summary page seems to not have a background color nor any picures
2. It also has a weird feedback box on the end of the page
3. The disadvantages page has a really interesting quote, but I think it would be even better if every page or none page had one.

Overall, i believe you project has a nice appearance and interesting content, but it looks like the work of four individual people rather than a group project since every page has a differend layout, style and format.
